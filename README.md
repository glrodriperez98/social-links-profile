## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Google Fonts (Inter)

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of writing **semantic HTML**, using **mobile-first CSS**, and organizing code for better readability. I also focused on accessibility and used appropriate tags like `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to improve the overall structure. This was feedback provided on my last project and I took extra measures to get it right and use semantic HTML.

Example of semantic HTML usage:

```
html
<main class="card">
  <header>
    <img src="assets/images/profile-img.jpeg" alt="Profile picture of Gabriel Rodriguez Perez" />
    <h1 class="name">Gabriel (G) Rodriguez Perez</h1>
    <p class="location">Florida, United States</p>
  </header>
</main>
```

### Continued development

I’d like to explore adding:

Light/Dark mode toggle using JavaScript or CSS prefers-color-scheme

Animations for button interactions

More advanced layout strategies using CSS Grid (A focus that I haven't explored but need to now that I'm comfortable with Flexbox)

### Useful resources
